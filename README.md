# University Course Planning System

## Project Overview
This is a learning project to develop a course planning system for university teaching management. The project aims to replace an existing Excel-based system with a proper software application, while serving as a practical way to learn Python programming concepts.

## Learning Context
This project is being developed as part of my learning journey with:
- Harvard's CS50P course
- Self-study in Python programming
- Transition from CLI to web development
- Introduction to object-oriented programming

## Current Features (Planned)
- Teacher management (assignments and hours)
- Course tracking
- Different teaching activity types (ML, EX, IC, PW)
- Weekly schedule management
- Teaching load calculations

## Development Phases
1. **Foundation**: Object-Oriented Programming basics
2. **Data Structure**: Design and implementation
3. **Basic Operations**: CLI interface development
4. **Data Persistence**: File and database operations
5. **Web Fundamentals**: Introduction to web development
6. **Web Application**: Full system implementation

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/course_planner.git
   cd course_planner
   ```

2. Set up Python environment (instructions to be added)

3. Install dependencies (to be added)

## Current Status
- Setting up development environment
- Planning initial class structure
- Learning basic OOP concepts

## Learning Goals
- Object-Oriented Programming in Python
- Project structure and organization
- Data handling and manipulation
- Testing and debugging
- Web development basics
- Database operations
